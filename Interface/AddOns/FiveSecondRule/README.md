# FiveSecondRule

This is an addon for **World of Warcraft Classic**

The purpose of this addon is to track the so-called "5-second-rule" (5SR), which refers to the time needed to elapse after spending mana, for mana regen to resume.
Notable, this rule excludes "mp5"-gear. The timer starts counting down whenever the player successfully spends mana (instant spells, that don't cost mana, wont reset the 5SR).

Once the 5SR has been fulfilled, the bar will show incoming mana regen ticks until full mana.

See the example screenshots below.
